# GRC-ISO27001

<h2>Description</h2>
Performed a mock compliance audit for Maryland University utilzing ISO 27001. In this audit I gathered data + performed mock interviews with SME's (Subject Matter Experts), completed the audit, ran a risk assessment, and wrote a email to stake holder informing them of my findings.  
<br />

<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>
<p align="center">

I gathered data on the universities Information Security standard in input into ChatGPT to perform a mock interview with the university's IT Manager.<br /><br />

I used this prompt:

"I'm looking to run a compliance audit of a major university's IT department. I need you to create names and roles of individuals. After I'm going to ask you questions based off of the information security policy for the university. Please use this link to guide you answers: https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012916"


Within this interviewd I provided questions based off of ISO 27001 standards 7.1 - 7.9: Physical Controls.<br /><br />

Once interview was completed, I entered the data into a spreadsheet to perform the compliance audit. I indentified the poloices that were out of the compliance and emphasized the threat and descridebed the vulnerabilites.<br /><br />
