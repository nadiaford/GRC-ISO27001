# GRC-ISO27001

<h2>Description</h2>
Conducted a mock compliance audit for Maryland University utilizing ISO 27001 standards. In this audit, I gathered data, performed mock interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), completed the audit, ran a risk assessment, and wrote an email to stakeholders informing them of my findings.

### Data Gathering + Interviews
<br />
I gathered data on the university's Information Security standards and input it into ChatGPT to perform a mock interview with the university's IT Manager.<br /><br />

I used this prompt:

> "I'm looking to run a compliance audit of a major university's IT department. I need you to create names and roles of individuals. After I'm going to ask you questions based off of the information security policy for the university. Please use this link to guide you answers: https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012916"<br /><br />


Within this interview, I provided questions based on ISO 27001 standards 7.1 - 7.9: Physical Controls.<br /><br />

Upon completing the interview, I entered the data into a spreadsheet to conduct the compliance audit. I identified the policies that were not in compliance, highlighted the associated threats, and detailed the specific vulnerabilities.<br /><br />

### Risk Assesment:
A risk assessment was conducted based on the likelihood and impact of each risk. I concluded that these two risks have an average to high impact on the university's reputation and finances.

### Stake Holder Letter
Once the assessment was completed, I drafted an email to a stakeholder at the university to inform them of the threat, its impact, and the potential outcome if not addressed.
